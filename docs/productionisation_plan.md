**Optional:** UX Designer (contract) during UI planning\
**Hosting:** AWS preferred (Lambda, ECS, DynamoDB, S3, CloudWatch) or GCP equivalent

---

## 5. Technical Architecture

**Backend:** Python (FastAPI), PostgreSQL / DynamoDB\
**Frontend:** React (or Streamlit POC)\
**LLM:** OpenAI GPT-4o with prompt versioning + safety checks\
**Retrieval:** Hybrid BM25 + vector DB (Pinecone or FAISS)\
**Evaluation:** OpenAI Evals or custom W&B integration

**Services:**

- Embedding caching layer (e.g., Redis)
- Asynchronous task queue (Celery + Redis or AWS SQS)
- Modular Tool Executor (DSL + secure sandbox)

---

## 6. MLOps & Deployment Plan

**CI/CD:** GitHub Actions + Docker + Poetry\
**Model Lifecycle:**

- Prompt templating version control
- Canary deployment for prompt changes
- Metrics logging: program match rate, execution accuracy, latency, cost

**Monitoring Tools:**

- Weights & Biases or Prometheus/Grafana
- Custom dashboards for prompt versions and tool failures

**Testing:**

- Unit + integration tests for each tool
- Model performance regression suite
- Eval results stored and versioned in `outputs/`

**Security & Compliance:**

- Secure API keys via AWS Secrets Manager
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Data redaction and encryption
- Retention policies for audit logs
